      I'm currently a Growth Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://getmagical.com/" target="_blank">Magical</a>, a startup automating soul-crushing tasks backed by Coatue, Greylock and Bain Capital. I recently graduated from
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a> (Class of 2021) after completing three awesome internships at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.ge.com/digital" target="_blank">GE Digital</a> learning across frontend, infrastructure, and network engineering.

      Though I'm an engineer by trade, I'm passionate about bottoms-up and consumer companies with interesting growth playbooks. I derive meaning from meeting cool people, pursuing non-tech passion projects, and seeing the world. I thrive wearing many hats, &amp; always looking to get in on something crazy.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably flying my drone around, trying a new recipe,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
